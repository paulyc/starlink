*  Name:
*     smf_polext

*  Purpose:
*     Create a POLPACK extension in an output NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     C function

*  Invocation:
*     smf_polext( int ondf, int store_angle, double angle, const char *domain,
*                 int axis, int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     ondf = int (Given)
*        Identifier for the NDF to modify.
*     store_angle = int (Given)
*        Indicates if the supplied "angle" value should be stored in a
*        POLPACK extension in the NDF. If zero, the new POLPACK extension
*        is left empty, but the POLANAL Frame is still added to the WCS
*        FrameSet.
*     angle = double (Given)
*        Ignored if "store_angle" is zero. The position angle of the analysed
*        intensity (what POLPACK calls "ANLANG"). This is the angle from north
*        in the spatial coordinate system of the output, to the analyser axis.
*        Positive rotation is in the same sense as rotation from the first
*        spatial pixel axis to the second spatial pixel axis (as required by
*        POLPACK).
*     domain = const char * (Given)
*        The domain name for the WCS Frame in which the "angle" value is
*        specified. If a NULL pointer is supplied, the current Frame is
*        assumed.
*     axis = int (Given)
*        The zero-based index of the axis wihin the Frame specified by
*        "domain" that corresponds to the reference direction. Only used
*        if "domain" is supplied with a value other than SKY. Positive
*        rotation in the frame is assumed to be from axis 0 to axis 1.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to the inherited status.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a POLPACK extension in the supplied NDF.
*     Values are put in the extension that tell POLPACK that the NDF holds
*     linearly analysed intensity, at the specified angle. These are the
*     values needed by the POLPACK:POLCAL task.
*
*     If the Domain is SKY, the reference direction is assumed to be
*     north. Otherwise, it is assumed to be the axis specified by "axis".
