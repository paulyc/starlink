*  Name:
*     ndf1Nsplt

*  Purpose:
*     Split an NDF name into an HDS name and a section specification.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Nsplt( const char *name, int rel, size_t *n1, size_t *n2,
*                     size_t *s1, size_t *s2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function analyses an absolute or relative NDF name and splits it
*     into the (absolute or relative) name of the HDS object and a section
*     specification. Both components are optional (unless it is an absolute
*     name, in which case the HDS name component must exist).

*  Parameters:
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the NDF name to be
*        analysed.
*     rel
*        If a non-zero value is given, then "name" will be interpreted as a
*        relative NDF name, lacking a container file specification.
*        Otherwise an absolute name, including a container file
*        specification, will be expected.
*     *n1
*        Returned holding the zero-based character position in "name" of
*        the start of the HDS object name.
*     *n2
*        Returned holding the zero-based character position in "name" of
*        the end of the HDS object name.
*     *s1
*        Returned holding the zero-based character position of the start
*        of the section specification.
*     *s2
*        Returned holding the zero-based character position of the end of
*        the section specification.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Any blanks which surround either component will be omitted from
*     the character positions returned.
*     -  This function will perform some simple checks on the validity of
*     the NDF name. However, these are not complete and complete validity
*     can only be checked by actually locating the object which the name
*     describes.
*     -  If the HDS name and/or section spec. components do not exist, then
*     "n1" will be returned greater than "n2" and/or "s1" will be returned
*     greater than "s2".
*     -  The component returned as a section spec. may, in some cases,
*     actually be an HDS cell or slice specification applied to a non-
*     scalar HDS object. This ambiguity can only be resolved by locating
*     the object and checking its dimensionality.
