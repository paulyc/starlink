void ndfXgt0D_( int indf, const char *xname,

*  Name:
*     ndfXgt0<T>

*  Purpose:
*     Read a scalar value from a component within a named NDF extension.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfXgt0<T>( int indf, const char *xname, const char *cmpt,
*                      CGEN_TYPE *value, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function reads a scalar value from a component within a named
*     NDF extension. The extension must already exist, although the
*     component within the extension need not exist (a default value,
*     established beforehand, will be returned if necessary).

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     xname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        extension.
*     cmpt
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        component within the extension whose value is to be obtained.
*     *value
*        The value obtained from the extension component. Its type is
*        determined by the name of the function called (see the Notes
*        section).
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  There is a function for reading values with each of the standard
*     Fortran data types: integer, real, double precision, logical and
*     character.  Replace the (lower case) "x" in the function name by I,
*     F or D as appropriate.
*     -  The value given for the "cmpt" parameter may be an HDS path name,
*     consisting of several fields separated by ".", so that an object can
*     be accessed in a sub-component (or a sub-sub-component...) of an NDF
*     extension. Array subscripts may also be included. Thus a string such
*     as "CALIB.FILTER(3).WAVELENGTH" could be used as a valid "cmpt"
*     value.
*     -  If the requested component in the extension does not exist, then
*     the "value" parameter will be returned unchanged.  A suitable default
*     should therefore be established before this function is called.
